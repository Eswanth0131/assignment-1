1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
 Oh, it's not breaking news. They're a different basketball team with a healthy hole LeBron James

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,920
 15 games over 500 when he's healthy three games under 500

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,840
 Creates offense for himself and his teammates. They need him. They all Jeff Steph Curry what he's done over the past month and a half

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,560
 Has been absolutely brilliant. He's as valuable as any player in this league

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,840
 They play great defense and they have the ultimate home run hitter

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,560
 Up beneath the team. It hasn't been easy this season

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,060
 But both finished up the regular season strong the Lakers ended with a five game winning streak

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,440
 And the Warriors ended with a six game winning streak

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,160
 Watch out James again with that right ankle. He played last couple of games did tweak it on Sunday

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,380
 But he played very well in those final two games

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:56,420
 And here's one of the fun matchups in this series Anthony Davis has to take a tough shot well defended by dream on green

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
 I

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,240
 Obviously both teams would love to get the win tonight and give a little extra time to heal and prepare for their opponent

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,400
 As Andrew Wiggins gets inside and gets the bucket

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,740
 To me. He's the key. They need

16
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,480
 25 from him tonight to be able to score enough

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,400
 to win

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,720
 Shruder nice play and drumming

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,680
 Well a big flush down the other end and that's a welcome sight for Laker fans

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,760
 It's not Anthony Davis and LeBron James making every play but you get Shruder making plays for drumming. They can be dangerous

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,520
 Can face more for three. That's good

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,160
 You know Steve Kerr talking before the game knows it's a taunting test

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,520
 Against a Laker team when healthy they're as good as anybody in the league

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,280
 But he also knows just one game. That's all you have to win. This is not a playoff series. It's a one game and move on

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,480
 Shruder's jumper ball tipped and taken by dream on green

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:07,020
 On the season Warriors 39 and 33, but they finished

27
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,120
 Winning 15 of their final 20 games in the regular season just great basketball as Wiggins

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,800
 Knocks down another and he's playing with a lot more confidence. Look at that

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,880
 He didn't wait for Steph Curry to make a play waved everybody out of the way and took advantage of his matchup

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,720
 James to Davis Davis goes right at dream on green again. Well defended Davis thought he was hit

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:39,580
 Lakers have not been dominant at home this season clearly a lot of that had to do with missing the two players

32
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:47,920
 As curry pulls back but despite all the misses says dream on green kicks it out to bays more and bays more from the elbow jumper way off

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,560
 Looney has to throw it up and hit the ram and it goes in Kavan looney very aware of the shot clock about to expire

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,760
 But Jeff you talked about

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,840
 Without Anthony Davis and LeBron James you were impressed as Shruder misses impressed the way the Lakers kept being competitive

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,880
 Absolutely defensively they remained rock solid. They just had some troubles offensively

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,420
 But what they've done defensively all year to be the best team in the league at that end

38
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
 is special

39
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,180
 Curry throws the pass stolen by Anthony Davis and number one rated defensive team

40
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,160
 Davis for three

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,160
 Rebound kept alive by drumming, but he's gonna be called for a loose ball foul

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,800
 Andre drumming signed at the end of March after a buyout

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,160
 With the Cavaliers

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,640
 This is his 22nd game start at all 21 games average just under 12 points little over 10 rebounds

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,780
 But Frank Vogels is still a work in progress trying to get him comfortable and familiar with playing with his new teammates

46
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,920
 Curry to looney

47
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,680
 Curry using a dream on green screen nice feet inside looney shot block

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,880
 Andre Chumman with the rejection looney was ready to throw it down

49
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
 James to Davis

50
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,760
 James with the tip in with a left hand and Frank Vogels I rate he thought David Davis got fouled again. I thought it was a good block

51
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:29,280
 Curry flips it up shot too strong looney back out to Baysmore wide open three

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,600
 And Vogel wants a timeout hot start

53
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,960
 Such so many different matchups to look at and have fun. Let's let's start with Steph Curry Jeff

54
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,280
 How do the Lakers try and guard him? What do you think their their game plan will be?

55
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,520
 Well, the thing I think for a great defensive team like the Lakers that they have to avoid is

56
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,040
 Overreacting to Curry and leaving others open. That's what's happened to start this game

57
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,120
 Be well mark a big question for Frank Vogel and the Lakers they've got the size advantage

58
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,000
 They've got the traditional centers Golden State likes to play small ball. How do you handle that if you're Frank?

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,360
 Well, to me. I like to see him post up LeBron James. It's a smaller

60
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,520
 Wiggins are last possession Baysmore defending him take advantage of that size of strength creating offense for himself as an aggressive

61
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,840
 Offers teammates Wiggins has had a terrific year defensively in the Golden State the fifth rated defense in the NBA this year

62
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:33,320
 Oh and Wiggins with the block of James has to fire it up and it's the side of the backboard great defensive play from Andrew Wiggins

63
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,840
 This is a great defensive play coach, but if my opinion LeBron lets him off the hook. He fades away

64
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,460
 There's no help coming. That's one-on-one beat him on your terms go towards the basket as opposed to fading away from absolutely

65
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:55,160
 Wiggins had a strong finish to the season especially after the all-star break not only the defense but averaging over 20 per game

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,800
 Ball deflected by Caldwell Pope

67
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,720
 Wiggins guarded by James down the other end knocks down the three

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,120
 Pretty good couple of sequences for Andrew Wiggins to start his play-in game. He's had a tremendous year

69
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,760
 I mean like when he's the third most important player like he was in Minnesota the year

70
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,720
 They went to the playoffs when he was there. It's a perfect role for him. I mean he's played exceptional basketball this year

71
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,480
 Particularly the second half of the year

72
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,720
 Drummond puts it on the floor double team back out to Davis shot clock down a three James a three-pointer way off

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,480
 And dream on bringing the rebound the Lakers have missed nine of their first 11 from the field

74
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,240
 Bayes more running gets it a Looney and Looney and a hell ball with Anthony Davis

75
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,880
 I'm just thinking about it think about your third best player with the ability to average 20 to 25 points

76
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,040
 You put Clay Thompson with this unit watch out next year

77
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:56,520
 Absolutely and I give Steve Kerr a lot of credit. He's narrowed his rotation. They play eight guys now

78
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,800
 There's more comfort level. They're an older team. They're experienced

79
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,240
 You don't go far in the NBA playoffs playing all young guys

80
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,720
 You saw Clay Thompson there once that injury changed a lot of plans for the Golden State Warriors

81
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:20,840
 James now guarded by Bayes more Wiggins helps out shooter good ball movement here called while Pope good luck knocks down the three

82
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,400
 And that's what they want out of that double team. I would rather stunt at Anthony Davis

83
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,520
 Stay at home with called while Pope and make Anthony Davis shoot and make threes

84
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:39,200
 You see shooter initially on Steph Curry. There'll be a number of players James with the deflection, but Wiggins able to get it back

85
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,600
 Shot clock down to four Wiggins pull up three

86
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:51,320
 And Drummond rips down the rebound drum and one of the premier elite rebounders in the game throughout his career

87
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,200
 called well Pope off balance

88
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:06,280
 James goes down to laying the runner and draws the foul on Bayes more

89
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:14,960
 Well, they get the switch and then they double and they full rotate

90
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,480
 That's a long closeout by Wiggins again. I would have rather stunted off of

91
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:29,360
 Called well Pope and made Anthony Davis shoot the long ball and Mike. Did we have starting line-ups earlier? Yes?

92
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,040
 I wish they were sponsored by Taco Bell and I could have said sponsored by Taco fall

93
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:42,160
 I'm surprised you waited so long to take your first shot man. You didn't come up for breath

94
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,480
 So I was I've been sitting on that

95
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 It's the free throw, but congratulations to you on truly a Hall of Fame career. It was an honor to be at your induction

96
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:01,000
 Absolutely well deserved and an incredible speech. You made us proud partner. Thank you gentlemen, but this is a fact

97
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,880
 I couldn't have done it without you man. We don't need to hear that. That's fake hustle. That's like saying

98
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,520
 Curry couldn't have done it without

99
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,040
 Jordan Bell come on

100
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,240
 Why can't you just say thank you do as well? Thank you. No, no, you don't mean that. Don't say thank you

101
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
 He's not sincere man. It's about him

102
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,360
 Warriors lead by six

103
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,880
 Shruder guarding curry again curry launches a three-pointer that one off the bar for the rebound want to Scott O Anderson

104
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,200
 Dream on green tries a three that this is drumming Halls in another rebound

105
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,160
 Michael Mulder also in the game for Golden State. Here's Bayes more

106
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,280
 Mulder runs to the corner, but Bayes more banks it won't go to Scott O Anderson misses the tip. Here comes James

107
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,600
 Shruder corner three James the offensive rebound

108
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:05,320
 Quick move inside draws the contact shot won't go but a foul and he will go right back to the free throw line

109
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,400
 But I don't want to sound like a broken record, but that's the type of plays

110
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,600
 He's got to make especially the way that they're defending him and I understand coming off injuries trying to feel his way through the game

111
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:21,080
 But as we move closer and closer towards getting involved into this game, I expect to see LeBron a little bit more aggressive

112
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,960
 Now you see those two games the last two of the regular season did tweak again the ankle on Sunday, but nothing serious

113
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
 Oh

114
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:53,640
 James missing a career-high 27 games only played 45 games at those 20 consecutive out with the ankle injury

115
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,460
 Now playing in the play-in game where he famously said whoever came up with this should be fired I

116
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,480
 Think the whole thing has been pretty exciting curry on the drive

117
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,240
 Flips it up back shot is good. Steph Curry with his first field goal

118
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,100
 Oh, just look at the size difference between these two teams on the floor right now at every position

119
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:27,760
 James finds called will pull another corner three another one knocking it down called will pull

120
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,600
 Two for two from three-point range

121
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
 Welcome back to Warriors Lakers

122
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,240
 Now if you see LeBron James go to the bench a little more often than usual in this first half

123
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:50,240
 Coach Frank Vogel told me that's because the more minutes LeBron plays the more his ankle tends to stiffen up

124
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,920
 So they are going to try if they don't fall too far behind here to back load his minutes and keep him under 30 total

125
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,800
 Now you just saw the playback in March where he got initially hurt

126
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:07,000
 This is where he tweaked it again just three days ago LeBron told us he hasn't stopped thinking about the way this injury

127
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,880
 Derailed his season. He had to rehab for more than six weeks and said quote

128
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:19,240
 I hated every moment of it, but Mike he said he's ready to move forward and he doesn't anticipate his movement being limited in any

129
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,640
 Real way tonight

130
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,160
 Thank You Rachel you forget how well he was playing

131
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,280
 Prior to the injury how well the Lakers were playing prior to the injury to James and David. They were 21 and 6

132
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,600
 Caruso wide open nobody near him and he cans the three

133
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,060
 and they did on that one stay at home on Caldwell Pope, but

134
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,720
 Caruso shot the ball very well from three this year

135
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,760
 Dream on green gets inside and draws the foul

136
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
 Andre drumming

137
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,920
 Green shaking up

138
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,680
 Well good stunt by Bayes more

139
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,760
 but Caruso

140
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,580
 Again really improved as a three-point shooter

141
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,120
 So green will go to the line

142
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:20,400
 Green has had an outstanding season especially defensively he gets the first-door upcoming national TV schedule team T tomorrow

143
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,400
 Indiana and Washington

144
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,960
 That game

145
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,720
 After Indiana with the victory Washington losing to Boston then ESPN Friday Memphis will play the loser of this game

146
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,280
 It's a nine Eastern start and will be either in San Francisco or here at the Staples Center

147
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,360
 Tell you Indiana played a great

148
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,480
 Offensive game down three of their main guys so bonus

149
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,880
 He's a great great offensive player. Absolutely

150
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,920
 They started off great and did not let their foot off the gas pedal Davis after kuzma Kyle kuzma Montrez Harrell in the game

151
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,160
 Dream on green on Davis one-on-one excellent defense again stolen by Bayes more

152
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:12,280
 Bayes more goes right at Davis throws up a wild shot and draws the foul Anthony Davis picking up his first

153
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,400
 That is outstanding defense by Dream on green one-on-one against Anthony Davis for the second time

154
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,640
 You just you just battle them

155
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,760
 And you stay in front and don't give them anything easy active hands

156
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:31,200
 Secure your position be disciplined and give your team a chance exactly what he did

157
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,920
 Well Bayes more in the starting lineup

158
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,760
 As Golden State has some injuries Kelly Ubrey still out with a left wrist

159
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,400
 He's gonna be reevaluated next week James Wiseman, of course

160
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,480
 They're center out for the season with right knee surgery Damien Lee also out and of course that man missing his second consecutive year

161
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,760
 Can't wait to see him back in uniform running up and down the floor

162
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,280
 And they need him and you look at this game for example the war is not gonna win if Steph Curry

163
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,040
 Doesn't get going at some point the Lakers are forcing him to get rid of the basketball way he sees bodies in front of

164
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,640
 The Scott Anderson misses the three called wallpult the rebound

165
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:16,320
 They're doing a good job of keeping two people he comes off a pick and roll. They don't leave them until he gets rid of the basketball

166
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,560
 Stuff Curry's taking just three shots so far

167
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,800
 Mulder some early minutes guard in Caruso

168
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,480
 Fall will pull my screen set by Davis

169
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,200
 Step back jumper won't go

170
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,480
 Green has been absolutely great defensively

171
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,240
 Curry against Kuzma, there's a double team second turnover by Curry

172
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,360
 Kuzma to Caruso drives inside lefty lamp as good as goes crashing

173
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,360
 Fogel again saying where is the whistle a lot of contact there? And

174
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,760
 Caruso off the bench with five points

175
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,800
 Active hands come up with the steal and good delivery by Kuzma

176
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,880
 Rousseau with the finish that's clearly contact. He should be going to the line

177
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,600
 Curry doubled again

178
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,200
 Graham on green fakes Davis right there

179
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,200
 524 Curry fakes the three gets away from Davis off one foot too strong

180
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,000
 And here comes Kuzma

181
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,880
 Lakers have made it difficult early for Steph Curry

182
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,120
 Kuzma a three-pointer

183
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,200
 And a loose ball fouls gonna go against Curry

184
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,640
 And coach, you know people say well, how can you get them going?

185
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,040
 Well, you can get them going by getting stops defensively and pushing the basketball is tough for the trap pick and rolls

186
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,720
 When you're pushing it in transition and a technical foul, I believe on dream on green

187
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,520
 No green Josh Tivens saying I don't want to hear it

188
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,360
 We now trying to talk

189
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,720
 Whatever happened to the parent that says I don't want to hear and then you still talking they said I said I don't want to hear

190
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,560
 That's the end of it. He just gave him an extra candy bar

191
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:12,440
 That foul by the way was on Mulder not Curry as Davis hits the technical free throw and now

192
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,360
 Much more pleasant conversation

193
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,520
 Josh Tiven and I have a difference of opinion of what no more means

194
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,200
 Josh Tim has become one of the premier officials in the NBA in recent years

195
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:34,740
 And you get a technical and since we don't count this as the playoffs it doesn't count against any suspension so you can

196
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,920
 These are freebies

197
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,320
 Sure, they're in there up top to Caruso

198
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,840
 And throws that advanced he was talking about the playing stats do not count toward the regular season and do not count toward the playoffs

199
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,720
 They kind of fade away, I suppose, but it's also, you know, it's the same for the broadcast. So whatever you say

200
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:00,120
 It's okay. You can say whatever you want. It's not it's not recorded. He does that anyway, Mike. I'm just saying they should count I

201
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,080
 Saw Jason Tatum's 50 as Mulder dumps it counts

202
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,880
 Put him in the postseason. This is the postseason. I'm in agreement with you

203
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,440
 I think they're they're trying to figure out. What's the best way? I just figured it out for him

204
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,840
 I'm just saying what they're thinking curry on the rebound. Oh, Davis is miss curry way downtown in and out

205
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,080
 And Davis the rebound

206
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:32,000
 Lakers shooting just 32% from the field, but they're only down by three

207
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,800
 Montrez Harrell spins flips it up shot won't go

208
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,840
 Tipped by Kuzma and another offensive rebound which he's been doing all season

209
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,240
 Schroeder misses the three

210
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,920
 And curry the rebound curry average the career high five and a half rebounds per game this year gets inside draws the foul counter and one

211
00:18:51,920 --> 00:19:01,760
 And to me that's the most underrated two things about his game the rebounding aspect and the finishing aspect

212
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,240
 That's just beautiful

213
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,200
 Touch around the rem this year he became the oldest scoring champion in the NBA in 23 years

214
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,720
 When Michael Jordan was 35 he finished the season with 46 points on Sunday against Memphis

215
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:27,000
 He was just absolutely sensational of course a lot of the talk this week LeBron James saying the other day about stuff curry

216
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,720
 He's the MVP. He had the best season all year

217
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,200
 Well, he's had an incredible season and it's it's a joy to cover him and watch him as Davis knocks down the little floater

218
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,800
 He was 0 for 6 Sanford. He Davis before that shot and it's back to 4

219
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:48,360
 But I like what he did instead of posting screen on the ball and get some space from green

220
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,800
 Well on to Scott. Oh Anderson knocks down a three turns and says something to the fans and runs down the floor

221
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,320
 He has one been a one of the great stories this year in the NBA

222
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,440
 East Oakland native now playing for his team and he grew up rooting for

223
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,880
 Shrooder shot blocked to Scott. Oh Anderson saves it, but right the Herald blocked by green but a foul

224
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,360
 And two free throws coming up for LA

225
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:25,920
 See the great ball movement and young fella gets it done Oakland's finest

226
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,840
 Proud to be a warrior

227
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,880
 Well, there's happy ending for him. He just signed a multi-year contract to play for the team again. He

228
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:41,600
 Growing up rooted for his undrafted out of Marquette back in 2015 took him five years to get to the NBA

229
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,640
 Mexico Argentina then as well of the G League

230
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:52,920
 And he has become so much more than an energy player Bob Myers absolutely loves him. He's got terrific skill

231
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,720
 He's extremely smart Dreymon green says he changes the game with his intensity

232
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,280
 And Steve Kerr says I trust him

233
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:06,140
 Been a great story and he's the one guy that can do Dreymon green type things on the floor

234
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,160
 initiating offense setting screens extra pass

235
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,160
 What a fine by the Warriors

236
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,800
 Steve Kerr actually calls him a mini Dreymon green

237
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:24,120
 You think I just freestyled that Mike. Well, I wanted to give a little credit come on. Looney the rebound

238
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,720
 six point Warriors lead

239
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,600
 And it's about a five-second difference between the shot clock and game clock

240
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,960
 Very just two for six to start

241
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,920
 Mulder Wiggins

242
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:48,960
 Rebound shooter final seconds no fouls to give here shooter ahead to Davis Davis three pointers up shot short

243
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,660
 Welcome back to the State Farm NBA play in tournament. I'm Rachel Nichols here with coach Steve Kerr

244
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,320
 Great start you guys got out to Steve. What was working for you?

245
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,320
 Well, I thought our defense was really good Rachel and it's been good, you know the last few weeks

246
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,160
 And that's that's what we have to play off of so our guys did a good job

247
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,880
 What's your approach to the size disadvantage that your team has here tonight?

248
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:18,240
 Well, we just got to make sure everybody's engaged all the time and you know keeping everyone off the glass there

249
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,960
 They're obviously

250
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,720
 Much bigger and stronger than we are

251
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,600
 But if we're active and we're boxing out with all five guys we can hold our own

252
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,840
 Thanks so much Steve. Thanks you Mike. Thank you, Rachel fifth turnover for Golden State

253
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:39,880
 James five points in that first quarter Taylor and Horton Tucker out there with James shooter Kuzma and Harold

254
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,720
 Horton Tucker straight on three. That's good. This young man's having

255
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:52,000
 An excellent season in terms of taking some steps, but the three-pointer has been at times a struggle for him a nice shot there

256
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And it's a three-point game

257
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
 Jordan pull the floater

258
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,240
 Looney's follow misses Harold the rebound no curry no green with James on the floor

259
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,080
 This is gonna be a challenge

260
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,860
 James drives can't get it Kavan Looney grabs another rebound seven rebounds already for Kavan Looney

261
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,680
 They'll need him with the size advantage of the Lakers

262
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,960
 Mulder catch and shoot that's good three-pointer from Mulder. He can shoot the second-year guard from Kentucky

263
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,600
 Well, you look at this unit on the floor for the Warriors right now

264
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,040
 No curry a green but they have the ability to compete at a high level spread the floor and they have shooting all around

265
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,880
 Shrooder drives shooter misses Looney grabs another defensive rebound

266
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,240
 And interestingly they have Toscano Anderson on shrooder

267
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,200
 Pull has it eight to shoot Toscano Anderson

268
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,520
 Not that time fight for the rebound Kavan Looney nine rebounds now already another three

269
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,240
 Mulder can't get it to go

270
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:12,280
 Six-point goal and state lead were two minutes into the second

271
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,040
 They played each other three times warriors won the first game

272
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,920
 Lakers two blowouts after that, but both teams obviously so radically different now

273
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:30,360
 Kuzma

274
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,440
 And it hit one of the wires atop the backboard so it's golden state ball

275
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:44,400
 Stop curry talking about the the Warriors. She said back in in February or March

276
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,560
 It was a little bleak, but he's so proud of the way this team just kept fighting

277
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:55,880
 And he says now we've given our children's elves a chance to make this season matter curry and green the leadership

278
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
 They showed

279
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,920
 The Warriors turned it around

280
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,800
 Toscano Anderson feet inside

281
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:11,960
 Looney shot in and out LeBron James rips down the rebound that's outstanding possession of great ball movement making place for one another

282
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,240
 It just wasn't able to finish at Toscano Anderson like you mentioned before mark and really

283
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,880
 Pass and make plays

284
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,440
 Montrez Harrell

285
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,160
 foul by Looney

286
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,480
 And the former six-man winner with the Clippers will go to the line

287
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:34,360
 It has not been an easy adjustment for Montrez Harrell last year played so well for the LA Clippers this year

288
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,640
 He's had some some good stretches his numbers are solid not playing as many minutes not getting as much touches

289
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,120
 But it's been inconsistent at times well three centers makes it a challenge for the coaching staff and for the three players

290
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:54,920
 And I think the thing if I'm if I'm Harold my mentality has got to be the way I got paid and made it in this league

291
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,120
 I gave great energy great effort great enthusiasm from day one

292
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,800
 So I was a difference maker because of the way I went about my business

293
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,720
 He's got to get back to being that then he's a handful to defend

294
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,720
 And I think it's interesting too. I think the challenge going forward

295
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,280
 For the coaching staff is at times last year

296
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:19,720
 They played with as a free throw rebounds given up they played with Anthony Davis at center

297
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,240
 So now that they have three other centers

298
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:30,360
 Do you ever get back to that lineup right? It's basically four centers that all feel they deserve time Horton Tucker goes inside flips it up

299
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
 And an offensive foul is called

300
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:42,600
 Tucker picks up the personal Frank Vogel obviously disagrees with the call Horton Tucker wants to see the replay

301
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,960
 Not a lot there

302
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,760
 To me that's not a defensive foul, but it's not an offensive foul either

303
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:59,080
 Pull to Wiggins Wiggins trying to slam it shot block Horton Tucker right there minimum of the rim and then a foul

304
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,040
 As Wiggins goes crashing to the floor

305
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,340
 I like Wiggins trying to attack like that

306
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:12,760
 Attacking the rim

307
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,080
 Good job of going vertical

308
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,680
 But I like like you talked about here

309
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,200
 They need him to be aggressive on the offensive end

310
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,040
 That was on Caruso

311
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,760
 Caruso picks up his first

312
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:35,240
 Here's pool and pool is foul before any shot attempt Caruso trying to fight over the screen picks up his second

313
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,200
 And I agree with the lake is defensive right now

314
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,080
 You have to treat Jordan pool the way you treat Steph Curry with that first unit because he's a guy that can get hot and then the rim opens up for

315
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,800
 Well the last six games averaged 20 a game

316
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,960
 He had a career high 38 last week

317
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:59,960
 Now with Curry on the bench Frank Volko said he's kind of taken over that like the CJ McCullum role in terms of when Lillard goes to the bench

318
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
 McCullum has to score they need pool to score

319
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,560
 Not that time as Kuzma gets the rebound

320
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,920
 Not that he was comparing him to CJ McCullum

321
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,440
 Horton Tucker short on the three

322
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
 Here's pool inside the arc

323
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:31,240
 Six on the 24

324
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,440
 Wiggins against Caruso

325
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,880
 Nice spin move and finish from Andrew Wiggins. He's got nine points. He has a great right to left spin

326
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:52,600
 Harold knocked away ball picked up to Scott Landerson two on one break goes right at LeBron James and finishes

327
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,760
 And a timeout call by Frank Vogel

328
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,960
 They got a lot of doubt down there. We got we got a lot of belief the job guys good quarter good quarter

329
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,440
 All they are on on the boards

330
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
 defending without fouling all good stuff

331
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,960
 He has been proud of this team talked about, you know disjointed early obviously the injury to play Thompson

332
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,920
 He said that they've come together really well as a season when on he kept telling the team late in the season

333
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,880
 We're gonna go on a run. We're gonna go on a run and they finished 15 and five in those last 20 games

334
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:33,200
 And I like how Wiggins is picking up full court on occasions James drives gets inside blocked by just kind of Anderson knocked out of bounds

335
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,760
 Still Laker ball

336
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,660
 This is just good verticality boys kid is tough

337
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,160
 Warriors have five block shots already

338
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,200
 James gets inside bank shot missed it ball chipped out to scana Anderson pushing it up the floor

339
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:06,320
 Mulder pool to scana Anderson out there with Looney and Wiggins Wiggins fires a three way off

340
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,880
 And it's Laker ball and you look at this game right now with seven minutes to go in in the second quarter

341
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,160
 One team is getting after it like they wanted and the other team is in chill mode

342
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,440
 And if you're the Lakers you have to respond because the Warriors are here to advance to Sunday

343
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,720
 Kuzma gets that one to go prior to that shot the Lakers were shooting 24% from the field. They had missed eight shots in a row

344
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,960
 That's a very strong assertive move by Kuzma

345
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
 Wiggins to Looney

346
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,760
 Piscano Anderson can't get the three Montrez Harrow

347
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,680
 with the board

348
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:54,560
 James finds Montrez Harrow inside and throws it down in a crowd

349
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,800
 This first field goal

350
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,440
 Timeout call by Steve Kerr

351
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:11,000
 The Warriors are shooting 38% 29 from 3 and Steph Curry has five points

352
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,680
 Now both these teams their defense has been a big part of their success as we mentioned Lakers number one defensive rating and the Warriors number five

353
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:27,280
 Pool goes right at drumming layup is good top shot from Jordan pool

354
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,960
 Lakers looking to push the other way Steve Kerr talked about that he wants his team to really push the tempo tonight

355
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,200
 Trudder gets some room

356
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,560
 Davis tries the three

357
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:46,160
 Dave is a not shot the ball well from three since his return from the camp injury

358
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:52,560
 Curry finds some room gets inside draws the foul banker won't go he's mad at himself

359
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:59,560
 But he'll get two free throws and that's two straight pick and rolls that drumming has been ineffective in defending

360
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,920
 He's got to get down a little bit lower. He has great feet

361
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,680
 He can do this

362
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,320
 But he can't reach and get himself out of position

363
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:19,120
 Curry has talked this year, it's the best he's felt physically and the best he is seen the game this year

364
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,640
 And the year off last year

365
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,360
 Might have helped that as well only five games played with a broken hand

366
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:41,720
 There's no question it re-energized and you know players will talk about this guys who play in the finals year after year the grind of that LeBron James

367
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,920
 That's one of the unbelievable things about what he's able to do. It's almost like another season

368
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,720
 And it has recharged him

369
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:59,960
 And a shrewder trying to get going still looking for his first field goal throws it away great with the steel

370
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,900
 That's great pick-and-roll defense. I mean that's superior

371
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:12,040
 Ability to play to play the ballhandler and play the roll man

372
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:20,540
 You see shrewder he's got to come off the score green stunning at him and recovering

373
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
 That's beautiful as I'll stand

374
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:30,760
 Steve Kerr talks about all the time he knows what the opponent is running

375
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,920
 He blows up opponents plays all the time nice feet inside but Bayes more rushed it

376
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,920
 Although Davis's presence had something to do with that called well pulp three-pointer short right back to him up top the shooter

377
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:52,400
 Call well Pope pass inside broke it up Bayes more this time got a hand on it boy active hands again from the Warriors pool

378
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,800
 Explodes to the rim and finishes Jordan pull his second field goal and it's back to a 10-point Warriors lead

379
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,360
 The Lakers have 30 points and there's under five to play in the first half

380
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:11,560
 Shooter fakes

381
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:18,200
 Caruso barely had it his hand knocks down the three I'm looking at that last possession Anthony Davis has Kent Bayes

382
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,760
 More on him and comes out the center high screen of rule the side screen of rule

383
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,300
 Oh, give me the basketball it's your time to be a little bit more aggressive

384
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:34,160
 That's kind of Anderson Bayes more fakes drives on Caruso leans in on drum and flips it up way off

385
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:45,240
 And an offensive foul is gonna be called on Anthony Davis and Frank Bogle hot once again

386
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,520
 Right now Dremont Green is putting on a master's class on how to defend

387
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:58,000
 He has taken Anthony Davis out of the ballgame now, that's that's that's just a smart play

388
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,320
 He puts himself in position to take the hit

389
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,520
 But he is in the head of Anthony Davis thus far and some join going on right now and a technical fat

390
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
 We'll hand it out double technical

391
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,560
 John Goble came in I believe it's on Davis and Tuscano Anderson the Warriors are saying why is it a double technical?

392
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:24,720
 Your dream on green you don't want to get caught in this you already have a technical foul yourself

393
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,720
 So it is on Davis, but the other ones on pool Jordan pool

394
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:38,760
 That's like the old line when the NCAA got really mad at Kentucky they put Cleveland State on probation

395
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:46,080
 Currie for three his first three-pointer of the half and from way downtown

396
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,000
 And it makes it a 10-point game again, but Davis is now at the five position

397
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,760
 And LeBron James back in

398
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,300
 Frooter 0 for 7 that's James Garda by Toscano Anderson

399
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:14,640
 Leans in excellent defense throws it away boy this cold let's stay defense as you said Mark

400
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
 They're putting on a clinic here in the first half

401
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,320
 Five to shoot for the Lakers

402
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:35,400
 Caruso shot clock winding down and pull with a foul with 3.4 remaining on the shot clock

403
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,560
 Davis gets that one to go just his second field goal. He was 1 for 9 prior to that. It's an 8-point game

404
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:10,060
 Despite the horrific shooting by the Lakers, especially their stars again. They're only down eight curry another three

405
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,340
 Back to back threes for Steph Curry now. He's got 12

406
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,600
 And this equals the largest lead of the first half

407
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,720
 Wiggins back in now Curry switches on James two former MVPs

408
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:33,240
 Davis against Wiggins

409
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,140
 Davis settles for the jump shot in a rebound to Scott Anderson

410
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,880
 Green beautiful pass ahead to Scott Anderson stripped by Caldwell Pope

411
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:53,720
 Schroeder tries a three and Schroeder still without a field goal James to Davis Davis blocked green got a piece of it

412
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,160
 And the Warriors go the other way

413
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,800
 Another forced turnover by Golden State Curry gets inside blocked by Schroeder

414
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,160
 Here comes Caruso the other way

415
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,760
 Caruso

416
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
 Almost tried an alley-oop to himself

417
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,240
 Somehow managed to get the layup to go. He did alley-oop it to himself got away with it, which is fine

418
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,280
 You can throw it up

419
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,080
 But I'll tell you what green not giving James a dunk to me as

420
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,720
 next-level intelligence

421
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:31,800
 Dream on green cross court to pull pull for three knocks it down eight three-pointer for Golden State

422
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:41,000
 Now the Golden State Warriors showing once again why they've been one of the best defensive teams in the NBA this season led by

423
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,480
 Dream on green and guys you got a figure you've watched so much basketball. He's one of the smartest defensive players

424
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,480
 I've seen it in all my years covering the NBA

425
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:57,360
 Well, I had the privilege of coaching him so I'm well aware from day one his instincts his intelligence superior

426
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,960
 True to the drive

427
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,000
 Nearly another forced turnover, but Caldwell Pope has it and a whistle and a foul. Let's check in with Rachel

428
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,820
 Mike this is so interesting according to all the tracking data. We have now if you look over the past eight years

429
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,200
 No one has defended Anthony Davis on more plays than yep Dremond green

430
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,800
 So Dremond told me that that means there's no surprises AD knows all of his little tricks

431
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,640
 He knows all of Anthony's instead. He said quote what it's gonna boil down to win this game

432
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:35,800
 It boils down to heart it boils down to who wants it more it boils down to who can outthink the guy other guy on a particular play

433
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,800
 He said it's not that I will go and say I don't know what he's capable of

434
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,280
 I know what he's capable of Dremond said it's can I stop him and as you guys have noted tonight

435
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,280
 We've seen a clinic Dremond's been doing that work Mike

436
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,720
 Thank you, Rachel as Wiggins picks up the foul James hits the free throw

437
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,240
 He just seems to shine come playoff time

438
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,900
 He lives for these type of games these type of matchups, but you know what he knows also coach. He knows that

439
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,360
 And it's his advantage if it comes down to heart and it's no disrespect to Anthony Davis

440
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:13,080
 But he has a fight his chance in that situation if it boils down to talent. It's Anthony Davis all day long

441
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,660
 Lakers shooting 30% from the field

442
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:24,640
 29% from three and they have 38 points with a minute and a half to play in the second curry three-pointer

443
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,920
 Too strong rebound Caruso

444
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,720
 Davis comes back to Caruso

445
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,080
 Pull all over Caruso and his headband knocked now James and Wiggins

446
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:51,480
 Caldwell pulp corner three is up shot no good and Wiggins with a rebound and great blockout by Toscano Anderson

447
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,080
 You don't see blocking out

448
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:01,880
 But he eliminated Davis's size with that blockout Wiggins nice turnaround shot wouldn't go James looks to lead the break the other way

449
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,920
 Pass inside Caruso layup tough shot able to get it off the glass

450
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,040
 Caruso is their leading score and they're only playing our double figures with 12

451
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,880
 And that's a good sign of you the Golden State Warriors game plan this

452
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,520
 And I'd like this lineup with Davis at five a

453
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,920
 Lot more from a spacing standpoint

454
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:33,440
 Pull cross cart Toscano Anderson with five to shoot and hits the three-pointer lawn Toscano Anderson eight points off the bench

455
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,960
 Back to 12 with 25 seconds remaining

456
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:48,480
 The three leading scores for the LA Lakers James Davis and Truder three for 27 from the field

457
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,400
 Truder the drive left as good tough shot. He finally gets one to go. He was 0 for eight

458
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,720
 And I'm not allowing Steph Curry to play one-on-one in this situation

459
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:06,240
 Either are they Curry step back three bang at the buzzer

460
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,880
 Steph Curry from downtown and the Warriors will take a 13-point lead into halftime

461
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,520
 What a first half for Golden State

462
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,640
 Defensively putting on a clinic and then Curry coming alive from three-point range in the second period

463
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:39,320
 Bays more steps back three-pointer way off rebound Looney, but he's called for a push

464
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:46,440
 Looney by the way had 11 rebounds in that first half as he picks up his second coach if I was Dennis Truder

465
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,960
 The bronze James Anthony Davis looking at what we talked about the impact in that first half

466
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,480
 I'd cut off the coach the coach's speech in the lockerman halftime and I look and say I've got to be better

467
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,640
 I've got to do a better job of taking care of my business

468
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,280
 Forget about what's on the board

469
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:09,320
 Again considering those numbers. They're fortunate to be only down by 13 as we've seen in the NBA

470
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,280
 13 points is not a huge deficit to overcome

471
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,040
 There's a shot clocks down to four Schroeder drives on Wiggins

472
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,720
 and a foul

473
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
 I'll take it on the side

474
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,000
 We'll send it over to Rachel

475
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,720
 Well, Mike

476
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,240
 I'm told there was plenty of excitement as the Warriors piled into the locker room coming off that great step shot to close the first half

477
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,840
 But I'm also told it only lasted about 15 seconds and then Steve Kerr got everyone to buckle down and refocus

478
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,480
 No major adjustments for the Warriors, but he did tell the team prepare for the Lakers to make some runs here

479
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,640
 They're a championship team. We just have to weather them meanwhile over on the Lakers side

480
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,240
 The coaching staff told players they got to be more physical against this Warriors squad

481
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,360
 They do have that size advantage, but they also told the guys just relax. We're missing wide open shots. Just

482
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,760
 Ease into it here. These are shots that you can make Mike

483
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,480
 Thank you, Rachel is dream on green picked up the foul initially Josh Tiven said

484
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,400
 It was on the floor but talked with his fellow officials. They changed it to the active shooting

485
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,160
 No, he got bullied by LeBron James into asking. No, that's that's the real deal

486
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,960
 That's another way of putting it and they changed the call and I'm not saying it wasn't the right call

487
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:29,000
 I'm saying that's why they discussed it and I would have a different message for the Lakers

488
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,200
 I wouldn't say relax. I would say we're too relaxed

489
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,000
 Let's do something

490
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,040
 No doubt Warriors look like the hungry team

491
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,680
 Curry saves it the right to shoot her on an errand pass from green

492
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:50,480
 And here comes James James gets into the paint mid-range jumper shot won't go loony another rebound quick outlet to Curry

493
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,520
 Curry to base more attacks the rim layup shot. No good

494
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:02,680
 Well the state looking to push it every opportunity

495
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,960
 Shrooter draws the foul shot won't go but Steph Curry will pick up his second personal

496
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,660
 And that's been a problem for Golden State all year, which is fouling too much

497
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,920
 And to start this half

498
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,920
 They haven't made them make shots. They put Shrooter to the line twice. Sure missed 14

499
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,640
 Days down the stretch with the health and safety protocols played the last two games

500
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,480
 But his conditioning is far from where it should be

501
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,560
 I

502
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:57,480
 Shrooter led the team in scoring when LeBron James was out mark they need him to be super aggressive

503
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:05,120
 Absolutely out of pick and rolls in transition at their best. He's that third option and at times carries them offense

504
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,920
 Curry to green green try to jam it James and drumming right there James down the other end lamp

505
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:20,440
 A foul count it and one stolen down and a chance for a three-point play and suddenly it's just a seven-point game with a free throw

506
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,680
 The coach a recipe for disaster if you're the Warriors

507
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,760
 Allowing the Lakers to get to the free throw line turning the basketball over and giving them easy opportunities in transition

508
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,040
 Sometimes teams in this league frustrate me

509
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:40,040
 But what the Utah Jazz just did by giving out

510
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:49,360
 52 full-ride scholarships to underserve kids is a home run that the whole league

511
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,960
 Should adopt absolutely

512
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,760
 When the players were calling the kids I looked at that video and I was

513
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,920
 Absolutely so proud of Utah and the players. I just thought it was brilliant

514
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:10,620
 So special for those young men and women as Wiggins spins and backs at home

515
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,720
 Back up to eight for Golden State Warriors have led the entire game

516
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,480
 Lakers have not led the largest lead

517
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:24,120
 Is 13 right now 57 49 called well Pope to James James kicks it out

518
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:30,520
 All well Pope off the bounce running lap is good sweet. Oh from contiguous called well Pope

519
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,880
 He's got eight points and I like that offense of set by

520
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,040
 Los Angeles having James as the screener

521
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,400
 When he's the screener it is really hard to guard pick and roll curry behind the back flips it up

522
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:50,520
 And went with short as Davis grabs the rebound and especially the screener with curry involved that puts in the dilemma defensively

523
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:56,640
 James to Davis Davis three-pointer won't go

524
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:03,760
 Lakers just five of 19 from downtown Nolan State has hit twice as many threes

525
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,000
 Dangerous pass stolen by called well Pope called well Pope down the other end lay a block but a foul

526
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,360
 Raymond Green upset after the turnover the called wall Pope will shoot a couple of free throws

527
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,760
 But again when we're talking about a team that's struggling to score you're giving them opportunities

528
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:31,200
 Carelessness on the offensive end by the Warriors and they're already the Lakers are already in the penalty

529
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,400
 So they're shooting the rest of the quarter while la hasn't committed a team foul

530
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,160
 No Golden State already five team fouls

531
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,000
 You call well Pope's numbers

532
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,560
 One of these teams tonight will earn the seventh seed in the West and the right to get into the NBA playoffs

533
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,640
 And you can watch the NBA playoffs starting Saturday on ABC ESPN TNT and

534
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,360
 NBA TV the winner tonight

535
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,680
 Will face Phoenix

536
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:05,280
 That game one will be Sunday time to be determined in Phoenix against the Suns

537
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,440
 Just a spectacular season they finished second Utah finished one

538
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,480
 These two teams in the playing

539
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,240
 Shrooder against

540
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,880
 Wiggins playing physical Wiggins spins tied up shot clock at five green another turnover

541
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:32,000
 As Davis brings it into the front court back up Shrooder puts up the three puts it in

542
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,240
 Dennis Shrooder just his second field goal, and it's a one-point game

543
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,760
 You get into rhythm at the free throw line. So he caught a rhythm at the free throw line

544
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,040
 And now he knocks in the three

545
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:52,480
 And a foul down the other end crowd doesn't like it. There's about six thousand fans here at the Staples Center tonight

546
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,120
 And this is just a wide open

547
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:01,360
 Catching shoot three and Mike you mentioned six thousand fans. I also love

548
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:08,000
 That they have they were able to get more fans because they have what a vaccinated section. Yep. I love that

549
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,120
 Kari step back three pointer and his foul

550
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:18,040
 Shrooder commits the personal that's gonna be his first and curry will shoot three free throws

551
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,120
 And I thought he kicked out his leg I would really think about challenging that

552
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:37,920
 He does get into that landing in

553
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:47,280
 And like he talked about the winner playing the Phoenix Suns want to say congratulations to coach Monty Williams who the coaches

554
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,320
 Voted him as the coach of the year. Yep this season in NBA a job. Well done and an award. Well deserved

555
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:02,240
 Absolutely terrific job, and I love their whole team attitude. They weren't trying to to manipulate the standings a

556
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,760
 Whoever comes our way comes our way

557
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,160
 How about the season Chris Paul has had for that team?

558
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,880
 Meanwhile these two coaches you will chess match right now

559
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:23,220
 Curry hits all three lead back up to four 18 points for Curry as a successful coach in his league for so many years

560
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:30,080
 Did you ever try to manipulate the standings and see who you was gonna match up with now? I just I had a

561
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,120
 Like just whether I was right or wrong that whole karma

562
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:38,600
 As Anthony Davis takes another three. I just didn't believe in it

563
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,600
 I if you want to if you're if you're a championship mentality, I just think you got to play everybody

564
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,280
 Blocked by Looney drum and try to get it to go

565
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,880
 He thought he was fouled again the initial dream on green defense on Davis forced him to pass it

566
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,440
 Wiggins step back jumper got it Andrew Wiggins now with 13 points. How about the move by Wiggins?

567
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,520
 That's not an easy shot. Oh, but he's got that right to left spin

568
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:12,480
 Wiggins one-on-one with LeBron James who's just two of nine from the field

569
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,200
 Jumper is good

570
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,920
 He's got to look at it like it's disrespectful as good a defend as Wiggins is you're gonna play me one-on-one

571
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,080
 Recognize who I am take it personal

572
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:32,560
 Shruder gets right up into Curry Curry splits the defense dangerous pass stolen by Caldwell Pope

573
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,640
 That's nine turnovers

574
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,760
 Now for the Warriors

575
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,800
 Four of them already here in his third quarter. We played just five minutes

576
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,800
 Shruder baseline jumper is short

577
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:54,160
 Curry triple team finds Looney

578
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,080
 Touch pass to Baysmore

579
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,400
 Corner three is good Baysmore with his third three pointer

580
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:07,920
 And now Frank Vogel wants a timeout the lead right back up to seven the 11 three pointer for Golden State

581
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:17,240
 You know what I'd like to the sweatsuits that the Warriors are wearing with pan homage to Oakland

582
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,480
 That's pretty that's pretty good. I love that

583
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:30,520
 Drummond hands off Caldwell Pope and double team him Davis swings it now shooter across the lane shot clock down to seven

584
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,800
 Truder giving some room

585
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,960
 hesitated shot clock at two Caruso on the drive on the pull-up shot way off

586
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,200
 And a 24 second violation another excellent defensive sequence from Golden State

587
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:50,560
 But I thought Shruder cooperated he had a couple of shots that he turned down instead of being aggressive

588
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,960
 And I'll tell you what I find interesting didn't they say

589
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:01,080
 Before the game that they wanted to limit LeBron James to 28 or 30 minutes. He only has eight minutes left

590
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,720
 He's sitting right now. He played 17 and a half minutes in the first half

591
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,800
 And 22 overall so

592
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:21,400
 Wiggins against Caruso Wiggins nice feet inside Looney gathers and throws up a shot off the glass just his second field goal

593
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,960
 But Looney's played some excellent defense and he has 12 rebounds

594
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,600
 And they missed him earlier in the possession by green on a slip

595
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,680
 Drummond across the lane flips it up and in

596
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
 Four points for Drummond

597
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:50,760
 Curry gets away from the double team continues left-handed off the glass won't go chipped in by Kevon Looney

598
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:59,120
 Looney part of those championship teams he's got the corporate knowledge

599
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:10,640
 Drummond calling for one-on-one with Looney spins in the paint falls down lost it and Bayesmore foul by Shruder

600
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,240
 And if I'm the Warriors, you're doing me a favor

601
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:20,440
 Posting up drumming against Looney. I know he scored the last possession, but if I'm Anthony Davis

602
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:26,960
 I've got a look to be aggressive and demand the basketball. This is not this is not a winning recipe coach

603
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,360
 I I agree if you can get them to post drumming

604
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,080
 That plays away from their strength, but again, I like this

605
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:42,060
 Inserting the highly intense West Matthews and putting Anthony Davis at the center position

606
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:48,600
 Matthews his first minutes tonight curry long distance. That's a three stuffed curry his fourth three pointer of the game

607
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,640
 It's back up to a dozen

608
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:59,280
 Toscano Anderson and Mulder back in now stripped by green and stolen ball loose picked up by curry knocked out of his hands by Caruso

609
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,200
 Called well Pope to Caruso

610
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,160
 Cross-court Matthews Matthews for three

611
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,800
 Talk about an instant contribution

612
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:17,040
 And that's a huge turn of events up 12 all the momentum going in transition curry turns it over and then a three

613
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,720
 Caruso steal on that an important play

614
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:25,120
 And then a foul called on called well Pope Frank Vogel. I rate again

615
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:31,880
 I'm looking at the sideline and you see greatness and Drake and Michael B. Jordan just

616
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:38,600
 Shaking their head as chef curry with the shot and the response Caruso to Matthews

617
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,080
 knocked down shot

618
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,080
 Given the Lakers life

619
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,400
 Matthews in his first year and there they are

620
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:53,600
 That it courtside dream on green block by Davis Anthony Davis sensational defensive play

621
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,640
 And green usually gets a layup of game off that fake

622
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,040
 To curry Davis calling for it gets it inside shots good at one

623
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,720
 Davis at both ends and a chance for a three-point play

624
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,480
 A coach is what you're talking about putting Davis at the five

625
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,840
 So the screen and roll takes dream on green off of him puts a smaller Anderson on him

626
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:22,320
 He can have his way gets the contact and the finish well, and there's room to move and post

627
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,920
 Here he starts it off. That's a tremendous

628
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:33,480
 Blockshot, but it starts with the lineup construction that with four perimeter players surrounding Davis

629
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,120
 He can go in there without drumming or another center clogging it up

630
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:45,800
 Anthony Davis only 36 games played during the regular season miss 36

631
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,600
 30 of them with that right calf

632
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:53,760
 He was starting to show signs last final games of the season at that 42 point game against Phoenix

633
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,920
 He has struggled so far tonight, but still a long way to go

634
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:04,280
 Six-point Warriors lead four minutes to play pass inside the curry missed the layup, but a foul

635
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:10,840
 We got to show that that is brilliance moving without the basketball and not a foul a goal tending

636
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,840
 That's right marks of two points for curry. It's just so good

637
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:23,720
 What if more guys were willing to move at the speed and the consistency of curry they'd be rewarded too

638
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,320
 Matthews misses

639
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:37,640
 Curry stumbles a bit now keeps his dribble alive against Davis lost it ball deflected and a backcourt violation

640
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,760
 Well Curry's been loose with the ball

641
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:49,080
 This quarter, but this is brilliant comes off the initial screen sets it up like he's gonna come off the stagger back cuts

642
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,720
 That's just

643
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:58,080
 Well Anthony Davis was saying, you know usually when a guy gives up the ball the defender can relax a little bit

644
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:02,000
 He goes, but that's when Steph Curry is his most dangerous after he gives up the ball

645
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,680
 I know I said it before but think about it

646
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:10,920
 You add clay Thompson who moves in a similar form and fashion the pressure that they put on your defense collectively

647
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,160
 It's unmatched in the history of this game

648
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,680
 Matthews to Davis scar to buy to scone o Anderson green looking to help

649
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:26,620
 Davis spins contested shot way off that one at the side of the backboard and green gets the rebound a

650
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:35,480
 Well-timed double team by green on the baseline side Davis now three for 16 to scone o Anderson pass the Baysmore

651
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:43,360
 Lot of contact over in the far side Baysmore three point one go Davis the rebound

652
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:48,640
 Under three to play here in the third

653
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:56,800
 Alex Caruso goes all the way blocked by green Baysmore the other way

654
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:03,520
 Tram on green again just putting on a defensive clinic

655
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:14,000
 Plus six assists five rebounds gets inside layup. He missed it ball knocked that about still golden state ball green thought he was fouled

656
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,640
 This Caruso turn in the corner

657
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,560
 Sees green

658
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:29,520
 That's outstanding defense and help by a Draymond green has been doing it all night long. That's his third block

659
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:34,880
 Warriors have eight to shoot Jordan pulled his come in

660
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,640
 The bronze aims back in

661
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:45,960
 Pass inside a Wiggins stolen by James. That's the seventh turnover here in the third

662
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,680
 They only had five the first half Kuzma to Davis the

663
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:55,400
 Fast break can be lethal for the Lakers and they've cut the deficit to six and the Warriors lose this game

664
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:01,080
 They're gonna look at this quarter and recognize. This is where it happened carelessness on the offensive end

665
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:07,280
 Another turnover, but Warriors get it back Wiggins for three

666
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,920
 Under two to play third quarter here in this playing game Kuzma backdoor lamp is good

667
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,080
 Timeout goal in state

668
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:34,440
 This one has been terrific the marquee matchup of the plan is not disappointed

669
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:43,480
 Curry tied up gets an inside the green green to Wiggins Wiggins hard off the glass won't go the tip is up and good

670
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:53,960
 Boy Wiggins playing with a force tonight at both ends. He's got 15. It's a six-point Warriors lead

671
01:01:53,960 --> 01:02:02,960
 Matthews cuts looking for Davis

672
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,080
 James three-pointer puts it in

673
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,920
 His first three-pointer

674
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,960
 Up the night and it's a three-point game, but you look at the post-up play where Wiggins had a one-on-one

675
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,200
 He shoots a fade away one leg of shot now knocks down a three

676
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,080
 That's good defense sometimes you just got to give credit to greatness. Oh curry beautiful pass

677
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,920
 But Wiggins couldn't handle it and Kuzma comes the other way

678
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:33,040
 Lobbitt and Davis throws it down Lakers within one

679
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:46,680
 Boy is it fun to hear a large crowd the noise of that once again curry on the drive

680
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:55,040
 Curry for three that's good Steph Curry from way downtown his fifth three-pointer of the night

681
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,480
 You know how tough a shot that was I?

682
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,600
 Mean other great NBA players

683
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,320
 Can't shoot that he is one of a kind

684
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,320
 On that type of pass it sprint catch and fire

685
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:16,280
 James back to order Caruso another backdoor cut leads to a layup

686
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:22,240
 But there's more space on the floor now that the traditional center is out

687
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:29,240
 And so there's more cutting avenues no fouls to give him for the Lakers dream on green wide open for three

688
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,840
 Welcome back to the State Farm NBA play-in tournament here with coach Frank Vogel Frank

689
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:44,720
 What do you attribute that lockdown defense in the third quarter you really forced a bunch of warriors turnovers?

690
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,280
 Yeah, that's a pretty good most of the night

691
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,760
 You know we wrap suited up a little bit in that quarter

692
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,040
 We know that steps quarter to get going still hit a few bombs on us

693
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,680
 You know we got to live with that but you know our guys are motivated and you know

694
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,120
 We take pride in the more deep into the league and we're gonna need it down a stretch here

695
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:05,440
 Do or die fourth quarter a playoff birth on the line you've got Steph Curry on the other side

696
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,880
 What do you tell your guys got to execute? Okay?

697
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:12,520
 Just that's what you got to worry about scooter our defensive coverage is and get a good shot every time down. Thank you so much

698
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:21,000
 All right, you'll James the rebound after the beautiful feed to Davis to tie the game opening minute here fourth quarter

699
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,160
 warriors

700
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,480
 Largest lead was 13 early in the third

701
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:31,400
 And the Warriors did a good job when Curry and Green rested in the first half

702
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:38,160
 But this is danger zone right now James inside back shot missed it and Kevon Looney could not quite hold on

703
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,560
 And it's Laker ball with 14 now on the shot clock

704
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:49,320
 And I love this substitution of Dramon Green coming back in that's just a beautiful pass to Davis

705
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:53,440
 You need to match Green's minutes with Davis

706
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:04,240
 Kuzma trying to get free and they lob it into Kuzma over pool lays it up and in and the Lakers with their first lead of the night

707
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:10,520
 How long does Steve Kerr leave Steph Curry out of this ballgame?

708
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:17,400
 That's the ninth assists from LeBron James Mulder to pull

709
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:24,000
 Bulls been excellent off the bench down the stretch of the regular season. It's a whole different ball game

710
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:31,680
 Mulder harassed and stolen by Caruso the turnovers continued a mountain the second half of the Warriors

711
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,760
 And this is where Wiggins was stationary that entire possession

712
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:44,040
 He's got to be great when Curry rests James drives on Toscano Anderson lay a bench at home

713
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,920
 Timeout Golden State

714
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:08,200
 Wiggins battling with Matthews Matthews an excellent defender throughout his career Wiggins trying to draw foul didn't get the whistle

715
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:13,880
 We said a lot about the late the Warriors turning the ball over you got to give credit to this Laker defense

716
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:19,440
 They have increased the value and I think it starts with who you're playing so West Matthews

717
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,400
 He has been intense as James goes in with the reverse

718
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,520
 And there and there's more room on the floor

719
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:36,920
 Now six-point lead that's a 19 point turnaround here on the second half Curry looking to Toscano Anderson driving layup

720
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,000
 Offensive foul James draws the charge

721
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,800
 Davis falls on top of them

722
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:52,280
 And I think Steve Kerr may be challenging this and that's a block

723
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,120
 It is going to be a challenge

724
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:02,680
 So they'll challenge those guys will get up and we'll see what happens

725
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:08,040
 Eight points five rebounds off the bench

726
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:15,960
 It's only the 11th and 12th free throws of the game for Golden State

727
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,800
 Second half so far

728
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:25,640
 They haven't played Mantra's arrow. They haven't played Portland Tucker

729
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,320
 They've gone with a very tight rotation

730
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:35,880
 Steve Kerr has only played eight players

731
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:41,200
 His team trails by five two and a half gone by in the fourth Caruso the drive

732
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:47,400
 Davis the tip won't go to Toscano Anderson a rebound again Draymond Green contesting the shot

733
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,120
 Curry back in the green

734
01:07:53,120 --> 01:08:02,120
 Davis on Curry green pass tried to thread the needle and turned it over I

735
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:08,080
 Had beautiful feed to Matthews good transition defense though from the Warriors

736
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,040
 Kuzma the drive can't finish

737
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,800
 Wiggins barrels in the Matthews offensive foul

738
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,360
 Boy what a call from Frank Volga to get West Matthews off the bench

739
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,360
 He has really had an impact as a coach

740
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,760
 You have to have guys that you trust that when it's when it matters most

741
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:35,720
 I know exactly what they're going to do and West Matthews has been proven to be a competitor at a league level

742
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:42,720
 And a guy that has no quit and he has come out and got it done on a defensive end especially this is why they signed him

743
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:47,680
 It's his first year with the Lakers. He's 34 his 12th year in the league the Lakers are his seventh team

744
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,680
 He's always been an excellent defensive player

745
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,280
 tough fearless

746
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,280
 Rob Polinka

747
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:59,520
 Wanted to bring him for these kind of games. There's certain matchups. You need him defensively can also hit a three

748
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:07,440
 Competitors only apply it's hard to find great competitors West Matthews is

749
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,360
 Davis jump shot got it Anthony Davis has come alive in the second half

750
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:17,640
 No Laker lead is seven

751
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,440
 Curry for three answers

752
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,280
 Steph Curry with a six three pointer. He's got 29

753
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:33,160
 So they clean a whole side eliminate the help and allow Steph Curry to win his matchup one-on-one and Caruso was substituted out of the game

754
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:40,320
 Curry on Davis isolated there on the elbow Wiggins looking to help pull comes over to help

755
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:47,000
 Matthews inside Kuzma shot clock at four Kuzma tough fallaway shot in and out

756
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,440
 Now the fight for the rebound goes to dream on green

757
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:57,920
 Curry on the drive scoop layup he banks at home all with a sweet move from Curry

758
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,080
 31 points and it's a two-point game

759
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,240
 And

760
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:10,240
 Pull just pushing Matthews out of the way

761
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:14,000
 That's going to be the first team foul here on the fourth

762
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:22,240
 No, Caruso harassing him true to insert it into the game Steph Curry knocks down to three gets a rhythm and keeps them off balance turns the corner

763
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:30,400
 Spectacular finish before the contest an efficient game for Curry 10 of 18 from the field six of nine from three

764
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:37,200
 Davis left alone for three got it Anthony Davis his first three-pointer of the night

765
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:45,920
 He was all for five and it's back to a five-point Laker lead get a couple layups get a dunk and now the jump shot becomes a little bit

766
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,960
 Easier he struggled from three-point range all season long

767
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,760
 Just 26%

768
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:01,880
 Well good find by James as Green tries to take away the role

769
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:08,120
 Always chatting away you straight on green

770
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:15,160
 Curry gets free drives inside scoop layup missed it. He thought he was hit Steve Kerr is furious

771
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:18,280
 Here's James the other way long three-pointer

772
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,800
 Carams out to Mulder

773
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:29,760
 Jordan pull all beautiful crossover tried to jam it ball knocks loose out of bounds and it's going to be Warriors ball

774
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,000
 That would have been quite the highlight for Jordan Paul

775
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,720
 I'm giving him a point just for the move and he got fouled

776
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:49,440
 How is that not a foul

777
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:55,880
 While you're looking at me, I'm not roughing Wiggins pull on the inbound and it's back to three

778
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:04,320
 Truder brings it up with 643 remaining

779
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,240
 The Bronz James sitting right now

780
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:17,800
 Well, he's at his minute limit I wonder if we'll see him again entry pass knocked away by dream on green

781
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,920
 Pool ahead to Wiggins Wiggins drives floats it up shot is good

782
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,440
 19 points for Wiggins and it's back to one timeout LA

783
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:31,480
 Marv Albert the greatest basketball announcer of all time

784
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:36,120
 Was impact on aspiring broadcasters is immeasurable

785
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:41,280
 Congratulations. Thanks for a spectacular career Marv Albert

786
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,920
 And I'm one of those guys three years with Marv Albert as a partner

787
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,600
 Congratulations legend

788
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,480
 Paul misses screen dives Kuzminow comes up with it

789
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:58,880
 Just passed the midway point of the fourth Truder draws the foul shot won't go

790
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:07,080
 I'm just trying to imagine you as a head coach of the Lakers right now

791
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:11,760
 Which the looks you would be given LeBron James like basically asking him are you are you ready yet?

792
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,400
 No, I wouldn't be giving him dirty looks I'd be giving that

793
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:18,040
 Whoever's in charge of the minutes police. I'd be like

794
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,160
 Come on now. We'll give them off tomorrow

795
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,960
 in the next day as

796
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,560
 Caruso is gonna come back in

797
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,120
 to the game

798
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,520
 Truder has struggled tonight just two of 11 from the field

799
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,600
 But it's the free throw Lakers back up to

800
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:43,080
 Caruso will come in and Matthew sits 11 minutes for Matthews. He made his presence felt

801
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:51,920
 I think the key obviously was the Lakers activity, but I think Frank Vogel found for this game

802
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,320
 Davis at five playing huge minutes already up to 36 and

803
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,360
 Going to West Matthews

804
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,800
 Was a huge factor

805
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,200
 In their swarming defense

806
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,440
 Truder goes one for two

807
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:18,480
 Caruso back in the guard Curry finds Wiggins Wiggins gets inside draws the contact and banks at home chance for a three-point play

808
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,400
 Big plays from Wiggins on both ends of the floor tonight

809
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:28,880
 An unselfishness of Steph Curry takes the double team gets rid of the basketball

810
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,800
 Wiggins aggressive turns the corner and if you anybody on a lake is not defending Curry

811
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,400
 You have to pull all the way over so he doesn't have ability to catch and finish

812
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,560
 Wiggins wants to get the victory get back in the playoffs

813
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:48,920
 He's only been in the playoffs once in his first six years in a league that was five games in the first round with Minnesota in 2018

814
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,560
 He has had a terrific season

815
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,680
 He's played 71 of the 72 games in the regular season and here in the playing

816
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,000
 21 points on 10 of 18 from the field

817
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:06,320
 He's available every game every year. He plays all the time as durable as any player in this league

818
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:15,600
 Kuzma back out the shooter shot clock at three puts up the three shot won't go one of the foul Davis the offensive rebound back up and banks at home

819
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,000
 But there's an awful lot of contact

820
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,720
 Not just on the shot, but also Davis's rebound and finished Anthony Davis discarded people Curry reverse

821
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:31,680
 With the English off the glass a little more magic from Steph Curry. He's got 33

822
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:35,200
 And LeBron James is coming back in

823
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,760
 Schroeder drives inside Caruso missed a layup Curry the rebound

824
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:45,200
 Curry to Wiggins

825
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,640
 Jordan pulled nope they wave it off an offensive foul

826
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:55,560
 Say on the screen set by Dremont Green not allowing the chase down contest

827
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:03,560
 James will return three fouls on green

828
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,760
 I

829
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:17,000
 Credit to Anthony Davis for not giving up on the play so his effort to try to get to the shooter forced that call

830
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,540
 That's 12 second-half turnovers for Golden State. They only had five in the first half

831
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:26,280
 They led by 13 at halftime

832
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:33,400
 Lakers have taken the lead here on the fourth. They've led by as many as seven right now all tied with four and a half to play

833
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:43,480
 This is a tough play to guard the curl by Davis Davis knocked away another steal from Dremont Green and

834
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,160
 Mulder in the front court

835
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:52,400
 Three steals three blocks for green curry on the drive gets inside foul line jumper. No good

836
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:58,280
 11 rebounds for Davis to go with 21 points

837
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:11,060
 Mulder up and into Schroeder drives layup shot is good. Oh, what a tough shot from Schroeder and Dremont Green wanted to push off

838
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:19,320
 Green's got to be careful with the referees he already has a technical tonight

839
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,480
 Gets the pass from Curry

840
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,640
 Pull for three puts it in

841
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:32,440
 Warriors back up by one and that's where Green is great. You blitz Curry

842
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,720
 And

843
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,520
 You get it to green and he plays four on three

844
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:44,360
 He's a great great decision-maker and it may boil down to just that

845
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:52,480
 Other guys not named Curry making shots being ready and aggressive because the Lakers are forcing Curry to get rid of the basketball

846
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:58,880
 Dennis Schroeder tries drives on Wiggins flips it up shot. No good rebound rebound Dremont Green

847
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,480
 And here come the Warriors up one

848
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,200
 with 315 remaining

849
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:09,360
 Curry fakes Curry drives floats it up banks at home

850
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,680
 Timeout Lakers

851
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:18,920
 There's the upcoming national TV schedule T and T tomorrow Indiana and Washington

852
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,820
 At 8 Eastern for the right to get into the playoffs then the ESPN on Friday

853
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:28,900
 Memphis winning earlier tonight against San Antonio will play the loser of this game

854
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:35,040
 And it'll be at 9 Eastern for more in these games visit nba.com or the nba app

855
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,200
 This has been a thriller here at the Staples Center

856
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,600
 Anthony Davis and the Lakers came back from 13 down took a seven-point lead here in the fourth

857
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,440
 But step Curry erupting here in the fourth. He's got 35 for the game and it's the Warriors up three

858
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:54,120
 And interestingly Frank Vogel decides to sit Schroeder and

859
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:57,160
 reinsert Wesley Matthews I

860
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,520
 Think it's the right move absolutely

861
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,360
 They got to make an adjustment because the Warriors clearing aside for Curry

862
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:11,520
 They have to recognize that defensively the Lakers do and be in position to help James looking to post up Baysmore

863
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:22,000
 Squares and faces seven on the shot clock Wiggins looking to help James four on the 24 James Jumper short

864
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:29,200
 Rebound Matthews back out to James past the Caruso corner three side of the backboard and Baysmore gets the rebound

865
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:34,360
 Now talked about it earlier Wiggins forcing LeBron did it at shot

866
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:39,340
 That's a shot you're willing to give up if you're the Warriors defensively against a bigger stronger

867
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,300
 And Caruso's defense forces the turnovers Curry dribbles it out of bounds

868
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:48,360
 So inside the Davis the runner

869
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:54,000
 No good, but a foul. That's absolutely inexcusable on a turnover. They didn't get matched up

870
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,080
 So Green had to rotate to the wide open Caruso and now Davis gets fouled

871
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:05,400
 So Paul picks up his third and Anthony Davis will shoot free throws

872
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,880
 Two for two tonight. It's only 74 percent during the season

873
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,960
 Big second half for Davis

874
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,320
 Only at five points at halftime

875
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:47,680
 18 in the second half one point game under two and a half remaining

876
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:56,920
 Curry on the drive the floater in the paint short Wiggins tips it but right to Davis

877
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:00,280
 James running the floor

878
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:08,160
 Past the Caruso back to James and he's fouled Dramon greed would not let him get a layup and James goes down

879
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,760
 holding his head

880
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:15,000
 The officials discussing

881
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:22,600
 I think they're gonna take a look at it to see if it's a flagrant

882
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,600
 And there's contact to the head of LeBron James

883
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,680
 To be interesting to see the conclusion that they come up with here

884
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,860
 But there's clearly with the right hand of Dramon green to the head

885
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:50,920
 Goes up the block this is a huge call again because it will be free throws and possession as green picks up his fourth personal

886
01:21:54,680 --> 01:22:00,640
 But clearly to me there was contact on the head according to the rule, but not everything to the head is a flagrant foul

887
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:05,120
 You need to make up your mind, sir. No, I I don't think it is one

888
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:11,640
 I think it will be called one and I hate when games are decided on these like

889
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:19,600
 Influenced by like these like they're trying to split the atom over there and just can we play ball?

890
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,840
 This is a great game. Absolutely. You have covered every base by the way, my friend. Well done

891
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:31,400
 Well James obviously shaken up by the play, so he's gonna get two free throws

892
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:37,940
 Will he get two free throws and will they get possession and he's smart enough to make sure they know he's hurt

893
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:45,760
 I'm gonna name my next son John go

894
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,420
 Thank you, John bring some sanity back to the NBA

895
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:55,880
 You know and again part of it. It's just such a crucial call for

896
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:02,840
 I mean he's looking he's going up to block the shot hands down. I think what Steve said there's no wind up and

897
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:10,960
 The impact is because James comes into him and I'm not gonna take I'm not gonna explain myself to the whole LA roster

898
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,480
 Play ball

899
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,480
 Well James will get the two free throws

900
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:22,720
 I'm not good at Ripley lip reading, but I think he just said something about trouble scene

901
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:34,960
 Though again as Steve Javi said it was an awkward fall and that made it look worse than it was and apparently got poked in the eye, too

902
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:43,040
 My only problem with it. It wasn't a contest to the basketball. It was a contest to the face because he can't jump as well

903
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,480
 I

904
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,980
 Ties the game with 207 remaining

905
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:57,760
 I've been there before squinting my eyes just in case I miss a free throw so I have an excuse. I've been there

906
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:06,760
 Had a rough first half but has made huge plays here in the second half a triple double

907
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:10,040
 Mrs.. The second

908
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:16,520
 And a loose ball fouls gonna go against LeBron James Jordan pool did a good job pursuing that rebound

909
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:21,680
 Really you look right now both teams are shooting the rest of the way

910
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:27,640
 So you if you're gonna be physical defensive you have to be physical and disciplined also where you don't give up free throws

911
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:32,600
 Each team with one timeout left that as Mark said both teams in the penalty

912
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:43,360
 Bayes more to pull Wiggins green and Curry and an offensive foul ball on dream on green on the moving screen

913
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,360
 West Matthews draws that turnover

914
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:51,880
 Steve Kerr can't believe that call nor can green who picks up his fifth

915
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:58,640
 And that's not illegal screen to me that's West Matthews selling the foul

916
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,640
 he's had

917
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,960
 Important impact on this second half

918
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,760
 Caldwell Pope back up to James

919
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,920
 Wiggins has done an excellent job defensively on him tonight

920
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:19,720
 Shot clock at six James looking to get a running start now past to Caruso Caruso on the drive inside Davis for the slam

921
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:26,120
 Lakers back up to with a minute and a half to play and Caruso has been outstanding outstanding

922
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:29,320
 great find

923
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:35,960
 Curry the drive looking to draw contact and he does but they say before the shot doesn't matter they're in the penalty

924
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,040
 So two free throws for Curry to tie the game with 123 left

925
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:46,240
 Well, they go back to putting Steph Curry into the pick and roll knowing they don't want to switch it

926
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,460
 James came off touched it to Caruso who just

927
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:54,360
 Caught it on a stampede to the basket and dropped it off to Davis

928
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,840
 Anthony Davis who had an awful first half

929
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,320
 Has come alive 25 points including

930
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:09,600
 13 here in the fourth quarter as curry hits the free throw and played 41 minutes so far

931
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:19,320
 12 rebounds as well and has made some excellent defensive plays in the second half this game has been so much about defense from both teams

932
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:25,160
 Curry ties the game

933
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
 137 points for Steph Curry

934
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:43,720
 They get it to call well pulp almost lost it shot clock at seven

935
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:50,600
 James two defenders on him to call well pulp inside. He's tied up by green throws it back up top James puts up the three

936
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:57,400
 Brian James from downtown as the shot clock expires a

937
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:03,600
 Desperation even the Lakers are up three

938
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:15,120
 Green back to Curry Curry sets leans in knocked away get it back from Curry shot clock at seven

939
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:24,880
 Bayes more on the drive kicks it out pull for three James the rebound with 32 seconds remaining

940
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,920
 There's about a 10-second different shot clock and game clock. They don't have to foul

941
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:36,760
 I'm LeBron James. I'm putting my head down and attacking

942
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,960
 Lost the ball gets it back Matthews for three

943
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,600
 Fight for the rebound tipped twice picked up by Paul 10 seconds remaining. I'm in a foul

944
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,840
 I'm not letting them shoot a three. They have a timeout left, but we'll call it here

945
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:58,400
 Curse trying to call it and finally he gets it Steve Kerr came to half court

946
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:05,400
 The officials couldn't see him or clearly couldn't hear him and he gets the timeout with 2.1 remaining

947
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:09,680
 We'll see if the officials look to see to perhaps put more time on the clock

948
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:18,480
 They got a great look the last time by Jordan pool in the corner of a nice pass by Bayes more

949
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:27,480
 LeBron James with the three-pointer had to throw it up the shot clock was expiring

950
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:32,440
 It's a big-time shot

951
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,960
 awful execution

952
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,640
 Realizes that the clock went down the good chase down by curry and LeBron

953
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:45,400
 Elevates and knocks down the biggest shot of the night. That's a 30-footer and you see Curry

954
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:49,240
 Who's had that look on

955
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:54,680
 Opponents faces after he knocks down threes the same look as LeBron James with a clutch shot

956
01:28:54,680 --> 01:29:00,120
 They're still talking about his

957
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:04,400
 Difficulty seeing after taking that shot in the face from dream on green

958
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,200
 All right guys obviously

959
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,400
 Golden state needs a three-pointer here to try and force overtime

960
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:16,360
 And for the Lakers there's not enough time for them to foul and not allow a three-pointer, correct?

961
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:21,080
 It depends on where the ball is caught and in what position I

962
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,120
 Wouldn't be surprised if curry

963
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:27,720
 Is used to try to free somebody else up

964
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:32,080
 Because of teams natural reaction to him

965
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:37,360
 No matter what type of cut he makes and that guy defending the basketball

966
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,860
 LeBron James in this scenario. I'd keep my eyes on curry

967
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:44,360
 Days more to inbound

968
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:48,660
 Pull coming free curry trying to get free lost the ball. That's it

969
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,280
 The Lakers are in the playoffs

970
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:57,000
 The Warriors need to play on Friday. What a thriller here at the Staples Center

971
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:14,440
 What a show these two stars put on tonight LeBron James with his vision

972
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:23,960
 Bothered after that shot from dream on green. It's the desperation heave that proved to be the game winner

973
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,600
 Offsetting the 37 points from Steph Curry

974
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,720
 Lakers will play Phoenix on Sunday

975
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:41,220
 The Warriors will play the Grizzlies on Friday night to keep their season alive and the respect from the two former MVPs

976
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:55,180
 Warriors with an opportunity, but a defensive play ends this one and that's perhaps appropriate with all the terrific defense we saw tonight

977
01:30:55,180 --> 01:31:02,320
 This is he didn't even catch it in rhythm

978
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:09,080
 That's just unbelievable just as the shot clock expired and he was blind

979
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:20,480
 James with 22 points 11 rebounds tennis cysts and the game-winning three-pointer is with Rachel

980
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,800
 LeBron

981
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,600
 Congratulations on the win nice little celebration there with Anthony Davis

982
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,960
 Yes, sir. You already know

983
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:37,680
 What does this mean to you guys to be officially in the play-in bracket and the playoff bracket and to do it with this kind of

984
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:42,840
 Win tonight over a team that has really been such a huge rival for you over the second half of your career

985
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:47,360
 Well, I mean going into the postseason. I think it's two of the hottest teams. I think we were winner of five

986
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,760
 They were winner of seven or eight or whatever the case may be

987
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:55,200
 So both teams playing at a high level and we knew that they're gonna come up to our floor and give everything they had

988
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:02,280
 You know, they hit us in the mouth in the first half and we just had to respond and we did that on defensive end and got some great

989
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,800
 Contributions from guys off the bench and we all you know chipped in for this way

990
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:12,280
 We got to talk about that shot you hit with about a minute left the three you didn't even look in rhythm there

991
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,280
 What were you thinking is the ball left your hands?

992
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,160
 you know just

993
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:23,360
 I put in a lot of work in my game, you know, you know after you know drape my finger to the eye

994
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:30,220
 I was literally seeing three three rims out there. So I just shot at the middle one and I was able to

995
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,920
 Grace the man above I was able to knock it down

996
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:36,120
 What in doubt go for the middle rim

997
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:40,400
 What did it feel like when you were down there on the floor when you took that hard fall?

998
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,480
 Were you worried that you wouldn't be able to continue in the game or have more problems?

999
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,000
 You know, I've been there before

1000
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,240
 You know, I've been poking I before you know on a rim collision like that

1001
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:54,580
 So just try to keep my composure, you know, it's gonna be pretty sore tonight. I know that for sure

1002
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:59,360
 But we have a few days until we do until we know when we'll go to Phoenix, but

1003
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,200
 It's a big time win for us and I definitely wasn't leaving the floor no matter if I had to

1004
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:09,120
 You know put a pirate patch on my eyes. So I love this team. I love to compete

1005
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:16,000
 One big rivalry down with this win tonight, but you've got another one to go with an old friend in Chris Paul

1006
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,440
 You mentioned going to Phoenix and facing the Suns. What do you think that matchup is gonna be like?

1007
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:28,920
 You know, they played extremely well all year and they deserve to you know host, uh, you know home court in the first round and

1008
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:32,360
 CP you know played at an MVP

1009
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,720
 caliber year all year

1010
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:39,920
 Book, you know Aiden has grown all year and they've given those guys a supporting cast around them

1011
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,720
 So, you know, we know what we're gonna get out of CP. We know how good

1012
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:47,000
 You know, how great CP is how great book is

1013
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,300
 Upcoming surgeons from you know from Aiden

1014
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:55,600
 You know, but it's the other guys as well that we got to make sure we can on because they've been playing extremely well all year

1015
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,680
 And that's why they've been the second best team in the West. Thank you so much for Brian. Congratulations. We'll see you in Phoenix
